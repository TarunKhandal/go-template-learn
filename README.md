This Repo will provide a basic example for Golang HTML/TEXT template(.tmpl .... and more).

When we need to write a well-formatted textual output golang provides the text/template or html/template package which is part of the standard library.
This Repository will give a gist of how to use templates and an overview of the template's syntax. This is based on my recent learning in which I need to render the data on the server side to create an HTML file to generate a PDF of it.
